### *I've got 99 problems, but dependencies ain't one*

This is a collection of actual problems / questions gleaned from a local R-help listserv.  The purpose of it is to find good teaching examples for how to work through and solve programming problems in R.

These were selected because they are at a relatively basic level - possibly requiring just about the level of knowledge taught at an introductory [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) workshop.  They are *zero-dependency* in that they are issues encountered in base R, not those having to do with use of specific packages, nor specific data sets. 

(I note that the vast majority of questions *are* package-specific, which might be important in thinking through how to teach problem solving.).

Please contribute examples from your own sources on listservs, forums, etc.!

While *solutions* are welcome (per [Issue #2](https://github.com/noamross/zero-dependency-problems-r/issues/2), what I'm more insterested is in the *paths to solutions for low-knowledge users*.  How would a beginner figure out the answer to this problem? e.g.

-  What would one search in the help system?
-  What would one google to figure it out?
-  What does a minimum reproducible example look like?
