### *I've got 99 problems, but dependencies ain't one*

This is a collection of actual problems / questions gleaned programming listservs, Stack Overflow, and workshops. It serves two purposes:

-   **Examples and exercises:**  These serve as raw material from which to create teaching examples and exercises.
-   **Reverse instructional design:** The problems also serve as tools for instructors to develop lessons and teaching methods.  I am currently working on a [lesson]() on "getting unstuck.  

Each problem as an associated [issue](https://github.com/noamross/zero-dependency-problems/issues) to discuss how instructors would demonstrate solving the problem, and how novices (usually those with only a [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) or [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) workshop behind them), would be able to reach the solution.  Some relevant questions to answer for each problem are:

-  What information is required that is NOT in the basic SWC/DC curriculum?
-  Where would one find the answer in the help system, and how would one find it?
-  What google search would yield the answer?
-  What does a minimum reproducible example look like?

These were selected because they are at a relatively basic level - just beyond the material taught in workshops.  They are *zero-dependency* in that they are issues encountered in base R/python/shell, not those having to do with use of specific packages, nor specific data sets. That does not mean that using a package isn't the right *answer* to the question, but discovering the appropriate package is part of the puzzle to solve.

(I note that the vast majority of questions I found in the first round of searching my local R-help listserv were package-specific, though, which might be important in thinking through how to teach problem solving.).

*Please contribute examples from your own sources on listservs, forums, and workshops.  (I only have R examples so far.)*
