Hi D-RUG folks.

Does anyone know of a function for the following purpose?  I would like to apply a list of functions to the columns of my data frame so that the first function in the list would be applied to the first column, the second function would be applied to the second column, the third function would be applied to the third column, etc.  Is there a way to do this without using a loop?
