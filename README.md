# *I've got 99 problems, but dependencies ain't one*

This is a collection of actual problems / questions gleaned from a local R-help listserv.  The purpose of it is to find good teaching examples for how to work through and solve programming problems in R.

These were selected because they a not problems specific to an R package, nor are they dependent on specific data sets.  They are *not* always minimum reproducible examples.
